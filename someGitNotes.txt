You make some changes to your local repo:
- add those iles
- commit those files
- push those files to your FORKED version
- from the forked version, we can make a pull request
- click New Pull Request
- ideally, someone other than you will review and merge the PR
- once that is merged, EVERYONE on the team should do a git pull upstream master
